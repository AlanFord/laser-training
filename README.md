# laser-training
These files have been used for laser training at HackRVA.  The "overview" is more of an outline for discussion.  Future improvements would include adding images so that the document can stand by itself.

The three "Using ..." files are step-by-step instructions for  
1. Using Inkscape to convert an image/drawing to a DXF format  
2. Using CamBam to process the DXF file to create g-code for use with the laser cutter  
3. Operating the laser cutter by loading and running the g-code file  

There is an "images" directory with images destined to be incorporated into the "overview".
